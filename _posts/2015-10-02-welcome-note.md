Many ideas and many topics, brainstorming for blog is chaotic. This was the impression with the first blog about personal and software development. Opening new categories and expanding research above related areas brought my first blog to the end. There was no sense in continuing that way. Lets leave it as “that” and move focus to the new topics.

Looks like this is planned to be something outstanding, solid proof of professional progress. Well, would be cool to get insight in that, compare previous and new blog entries and see how is progress reflected with each new content. That could be the motivation behind, when someone asks.

Categories should cover many topics, including personal and technical stuff with plenty of info, tutorials, open topics for discussion and many more.

Officially started.
